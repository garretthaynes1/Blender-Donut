# Blender-Donut
donut.obj is the actual file for the donut,  If you'd like to view it youll need a software that can open it.

Something that I learned about while working on my project is called Ray Tracing, Which is a method that 3d renderers use to simulate light rays in order to more realistically render textures and shadows.  
Some cool methods that I used was an ai imlemented within Blender, that interprets what a render should look like before its finished, allowing me to work with a fully rendered version of my model before ive finished.  This can be seen in the screenshot posted in the repository.
